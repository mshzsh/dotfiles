# My Arch Linux on Wayland Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfile repository where I share the configuration files and settings for my customized Arch Linux setup running on the Wayland display protocol. These dotfiles represent my personal preferences and optimizations for a smooth and efficient desktop environment.

## Overview

- **Operating System**: Arch Linux
- **Display Server**: Wayland
- **Window Manager**: Hyprland
- **Terminal Emulator**: Guake
- **Shell**: Fish
- **Editor**: Neovim

## Installation

1. **Clone this Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mshzsh/dotfiles.git

2. **Copy Dotfiles to Their Respective Directories**:

    Copy the dotfiles to their respective directories, overwriting existing configurations if necessary. Be sure to make backups of your existing configurations if you need to preserve them.

    Example for copying a configuration file:
    ```
    cp config-file ~/.config/
    ```
    Replace config-file with the name of the specific configuration file, and ~/.config/ with the directory path where it should be placed.
